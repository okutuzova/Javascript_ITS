## Exercise Requirements
● Store your birth year in a variable.
● Store a future year in a variable.
● Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.
● For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what 
month it is in 2026.
● Output them to the console like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the 
values.


## Solution
- I created an `index.html` file with basic HTML structure.
- I created a `main.js` file to define variables and output the fortune to the console.
- The output is displayed in the browser's console when the page is loaded.

## Files:
- `index.html` - Basic HTML structure.
- `main.js` - JavaScript for storing variables and printing the fortune.
