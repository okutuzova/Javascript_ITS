## Exercise Requirements
Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.
● Store a radius into a variable.
● Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
● Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".


## Solution
- I created an `index.html` file with basic HTML structure.
- I created a `main.js` file. In this file I created a function to calculate circumference. The function takes radius as an argument and returns a calculation of circumference. The next function is used to calculate area. I declared a variable with a radius value and output the result in console.


## Files:
- `index.html` - Basic HTML structure.
- `main.js` - JavaScript for storing variables and printing the fortune.
