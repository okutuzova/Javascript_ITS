## Solution
- Compiler and Interpreter Critical Differences
The article contrasts compilers and interpreters in programming. A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code before execution, producing an independent executable file, which generally leads to faster execution. In contrast, an interpreter translates the source code line by line, executing it immediately, making debugging easier but leading to slower performance. The article highlights key differences such as error handling, performance, and portability.

- Levels of Programming Languages
The article classifies the programming languages into three categories: machine languages, asssembly languages, and high level languages. machine language is the lowest level described as a series of binary patterns. In assembly languages simple pneumonic abbreviations are used. Prior to execution a translation to the machine language is required. High-level languages reuire a compiler or an interpreter for the code to be translated for the machine to understand it. Compilers translate all the code before execution while interpreters execute the translation line by line. 

- Bonus Machine Language vs. Assembly Language

The article describes main differences between machine language and assembly language. Machine language is explained as a collection of bits for a computer to read and interpret. Assembly language gives access to influencing how the hardware and software work. It varies at the machine level because each microprocessor relies on its own set of supported instructions. 
Both types are considered low-level programming languages. One of the key differences highlighted in the article is the level of abstraction in both language paradigms. machine language is much closer to the hardware while assembly language uses mnemonics and symbols to represent machine language instructions. Another key difference mentioned is level of control. Machine language allows only direct manipulation of the binary code, while assembly language provides a higher level of control by permitting manipulations of memory locations, system calls, register values.
