## Exercise Requirements
● Make a list of all the programming languages that you know  
● Classify the languages into the groups: compiled, interpreted, other  
● For each language, explain why it is compile, interpreted or other  
● Try to find additional programming languages and add them to the list    


## Solution
● Python, Javascript, Typescript, Java, C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Visual Basic, Fortran, Go, Pascal, Swift, Rust, Kotlin, Haskell, R  

● Compiled: C, C++. Fortran, Pascal, Typescript, GO, Swift, Rust, Kotlin, Haskell
Interpreted: Python, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, R
Other: Java (both compiled and interpreted)

● Compiled Languages:
C, C++: These languages are compiled into machine code, which makes execution very fast. Compilers convert the source code to executable programs before running them.  
Fortran, Pascal: These languages are compiled into machine code, improving performance and efficiency for numerical and system-level tasks.  
Go, Swift, Rust: These languages are compiled for efficiency and performance. Their compilers generate machine code or intermediate code for fast execution.  
Kotlin, Haskell: These languages are compiled to bytecode or machine code, offering performance optimizations and strong type systems.  

Interpreted Languages:  
Python: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, which makes it slower than compiled languages but easier to debug.  
JavaScript: JavaScript runs in the browser or Node.js environment using an interpreter, making development faster but execution slower compared to compiled languages.  
Ruby, PHP: These scripting languages are executed directly by an interpreter at runtime.   
R: R is interpreted, allowing for interactive execution of commands, which is ideal for data analysis.  

Other (Both Compiled and Interpreted):  
Java: Java follows a two-step process. First, it's compiled into bytecode by a compiler. Then, this bytecode is interpreted (or compiled further to machine code) by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent.
