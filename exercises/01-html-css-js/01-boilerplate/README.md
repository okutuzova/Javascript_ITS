Create a folder named 01-boilerplate with your solution  


## Solution
My Boilerplate includes an opening tag __Doctype__ that tells the browser that it is an html-document. Below there is a tag indicating that the language of this page is English. In the element __head__ I included a title, metadata. Metadata include description, keywords, author, viewport, and robots. Description and keywords help the search engine understand the content of the page, viewport sets the screen settings, robots indicate that this oage is to be indexed by a search engine.

In the __body__ element I place an __h1__ with a title of the page to be displayed in the browser.
