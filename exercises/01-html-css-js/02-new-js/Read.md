Build your first Javascript project  
● Write your index.html file from scratch

Create a folder named 02-new-js with your solution  

## Solution
I created an index.html file following a pattern from the previous exercise. I created a folder named "script" which contains a "main.js" file. This file prints the name of a student to the browser console through a built-in Javascript function __console.log__.
