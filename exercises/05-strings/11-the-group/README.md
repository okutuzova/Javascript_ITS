## Exercise Requirements
‚óè Use the previous function to write another function called group that checks whether a string is 
part of another longer string that is a list of names of a group

 
## Solution
- I created an `index.html` file with basic HTML structure.
- In the `main.js` file the function from the previous exercise is implemented with no changes. It checks if a substring is present in a string using .includes() method. The second function __group()__ takes two strings as parameters and calls aContainsB to check if the first string contains the second. The ternary operator logs result in the console using the literal templates.
