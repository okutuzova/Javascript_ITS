## Exercise Requirements
● Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20.   
● For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and 
report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").  

 
## Solution
- I created an `index.html` file with basic HTML structure.
- I created a `main.js` file to write a function __checkOddorEven__ that takes one parameter and checks if it is an even or an odd number. Below I also created functions that have the same functionality, but one uses a ternary operator and another uses an object literal. Using a ternary operator in this case is justified as the checked condition is easy to read. Below the function declarations the for loops are added, each one containing a respective function call. As a result, three times even and odd numbers from 0 to 20 are logged in the console.
