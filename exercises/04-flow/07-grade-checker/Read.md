## Exercise Requirements
● Write a loop that tests the function that you wrote earlier “assignGrade”.  
● Check every value from 60 to 100:   
○ your log should show   
■ “For 88, you got a B.”  
■ “For 89, you got a B.”  
■ “For 90, you got an A.”  

 
## Solution
- I created an `index.html` file with basic HTML structure.
- I created a `main.js` file that contains an import statement of a function from the exercise 03-grade-master. There is a for loop that iterates from 60 to 100, invokes an imported function on each iteration and logs out the result. There is also a check if grade falls into 90-100 interval, than "an" instead of "a" is logged. 





## Files:
- `index.html` - Basic HTML structure.
- `main.js` - JavaScript for a function helloWorld.
- `Read.md` - exercise requirements and solution.
